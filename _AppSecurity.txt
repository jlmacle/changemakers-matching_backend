"The majority of attacks against web applications 
involve sending input to the server that is crafted to cause some event 
that was not expected or desired by the application's designer.
Here are some examples of submitting crafted input to achieve this objective:
- Changing the price of a product transmitted in a hidden HTML form field 
to fraudulently purchase the product for a cheaper amount.
- Modifying a session token transmitted in an HTTP cookie
to hijack the session of another authenticated user.
- Removing certain parameters that normally are submitted 
to exploit a logic flaw in the application's processing.
- Altering some input that will be processed by a back-end database 
to inject a malicious database query and access sensitive data.", p.9

"In terms of attack surface,
the session management mechanism is highly dependent
on the security of its tokens.", p.20

"Most web development languages provide good error-handling support
through try-catch blocks and checked exceptions.
Application code should make extensive use of these constructs
to catch specific and general errors
and handle them appropriately.", p. 30

"Most application servers can be configured 
to deal with unhandled application errors in customized ways 
such as by presenting an uninformative error message.", p.30
